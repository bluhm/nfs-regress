Use a NFS filesystem mounted via loopback.  By changing files
directly on the server and accessing on the client specific kernel
behavior can be triggered.  Especially using file mmap(2) over
NFS should be tested.

These tests must be run as root, on a system with free vnd0 slot.
They create an entry in /etc/exports and start NFS server daemons
for a loopback mount.
